#For Printing and not a new line i.e. after print what is inside the print statement will not move to the new line we have to use the 'print' keyword.

print("Hello World")

=begin
The 'print' statement is quite similar to python.
But here is the catch that another way to use the 'print' keyword is --> ::syntax:: [print "{Write what you want to write}"]. 
Also remember that the 'print' statement will not work when use curly braces '{}'.
=end

print "Hello World"

=begin
Now We move to another way to print things in Ruby.
We can use another keyword to print things i.e., 'puts'.
It works just like 'print', but it adds a newline character at the end of what you print.
It works for normal braces and no braces, but not curly braces.
=end

puts "Hello World"

puts("Hello World")
